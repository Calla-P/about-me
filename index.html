    <img src="selfie.jpeg" alt=" A photo of Paula D" class="center">

<p> I am a student at Code Fellows and am motivated to pursue my dreams in this lifetime. To live a full life will require me to have a black mamba mentality and resilence. I am working everyday to become a desireable, innovative, badass software developer. Remote work, understanding problem solving patterns, autonomy, and working in a skilled team enviroment are the things I am seeking.  </p>

<h3> Top Ten Hikes I've experienced. </h3>

<div> I really respect nature and have deep gratitude for the ways it supports us. In this modern life I know I am more balanced by having a daily practice of noticing nature. It is not always epic, most days it is simple and subtle. I walk in the rain. I walk without shoes on. I learn from the power of the elements. Stare at fire. Sing to my water and so on. </div>
